KJNotepad is a simple iOS app, similar to the built-in "Notes" app, written in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

It demonstrates implementation of these features:

- Core Data with iCloud syncing
- split view controller
- responding to keyboard show/hide notifications

## To-Do

- UI polish
- sharing
- WatchKit
